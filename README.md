<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of PkgTst is to figure out how to create a package for STAT375
and my science scholar project use.

## Installation

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dakthomps00/PktTst")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(PkgTst)
add(2,2)
#> [1] 4
# 2+2
```
